# BRC-104: HTTP Transport for BRC-103 Mutual Authentication

- Ty Everett (ty@projectbabbage.com)

## 1. Abstract

This specification defines how to **transport** BRC-103 [1] mutual authentication messages via **HTTP**. It introduces:

- A **`.well-known/auth`** endpoint for **non-general** BRC-103 messages (e.g. handshake, certificate requests).  
- A mechanism for **embedding** “general” messages in normal HTTP requests/responses using custom `x-bsv-auth` headers and an **encoded** request/response “payload.”  
- Clear rules for **which HTTP headers** are included in the signature and which are excluded, ensuring consistent signing and verification on both client and server.  
- An approach for referencing the remote peer’s identity key and session parameters in standard HTTP requests/responses.

By adopting this scheme, implementers can re-use BRC-103’s cryptographic handshake and selective certificate exchange logic in a typical browser–server or server–server HTTP environment.

---

## 2. Introduction

BRC-103 [1] defines a peer-to-peer mutual authentication flow but leaves the **transport** unspecified. This document describes an **HTTP** layering for that flow. It details:

- **Endpoints** and **message paths** for BRC-103 handshake messages.  
- A scheme for “general” messages that carry an entire HTTP request/response inside a single BRC-103 message.  
- **Custom** HTTP headers that store BRC-103 parameters (nonces, signatures, identity keys, requested certificates, etc.).  
- Mechanisms to handle typical web scenarios such as 402 Payment Required or other status codes.

Where BRC-103 gives a general outline (initialRequest, initialResponse, general, certificateRequest, certificateResponse), BRC-104 explains how those messages appear as **HTTP requests** and **HTTP responses**.

## 3. Relationship to BRC-103

- **Mandatory Prerequisite**: Implementers **MUST** implement or rely on BRC-103’s handshake, message types, and signature logic.  
- This specification **extends** BRC-103 by **mapping** each BRC-103 message type onto **HTTP** requests and responses, describing **/.well-known/auth** usage, specialized headers (`x-bsv-auth-*`), and the structured “payload” approach for general messages.

Whenever conflicts arise, **BRC-103** is authoritative on handshake semantics and certificate exchange. **BRC-104** only clarifies how to wrap those messages in HTTP.

## 4. Terminology & Definitions

- **BRC-103 Message**: One of `initialRequest`, `initialResponse`, `certificateRequest`, `certificateResponse`, or `general`.  
- **Non-General Message**: A BRC-103 message of type `initialRequest`, `initialResponse`, `certificateRequest`, or `certificateResponse`.  
- **General Message**: A BRC-103 message of type `general`, used to transmit an entire HTTP request or response under the authenticated session.  
- **Peer**: A user agent (client) or server implementing the protocol.  
- **`x-bsv-auth-` Headers**: A family of custom HTTP headers that store BRC-103 parameters (identity key, nonce, signature, etc.).  
- **`x-bsv-payment` Header**: An optional header used for embedding BSV payment data (e.g. 402 flows).  
- **`.well-known/auth` Endpoint**: The canonical path for sending **non-general** messages as JSON in a `POST` body.

## 5. High-Level Overview

1. **Non-General** BRC-103 messages (initialRequest, initialResponse, certificateRequest, certificateResponse) are sent as:
   - **HTTP POST** to `/.well-known/auth`, with a **JSON**-serialized AuthMessage in the request body.
   - The server processes it, possibly returning an AuthMessage in JSON.  
2. **General** BRC-103 messages are carried by a normal HTTP request to **any** path (e.g., `/api/v1/orders`), but **encoded** within custom headers plus a raw binary “payload.”  
3. The server intercepts that request, reconstructs the “general” BRC-103 message, verifies signatures, and eventually returns a corresponding “general” BRC-103 response.  

This layering effectively merges the BRC-103 handshake and certificate logic with standard HTTP request/response cycles.

## 6. Detailed Specification

### 6.1 HTTP Endpoints

**MUST** define at least one endpoint:
- `POST /.well-known/auth`
  - Accepts a JSON body representing a BRC-103 AuthMessage (any **non-general** type).
  - The server verifies the BRC-103 signature. On success, it **MAY** respond with another non-general BRC-103 message as JSON (e.g. `initialResponse` or `certificateResponse`).
  - If the handshake is incomplete or invalid, the server responds with an HTTP 4xx.

Other resource endpoints (e.g. `/myapp/orders`) **MAY** handle **general** messages. The request body is an ordinary HTTP request body, while key BRC-103 fields (signature, identityKey, etc.) are placed in custom headers and an encoded “payload.”

### 6.2 Header Conventions

**BRC-104** introduces the following headers:

1. **`x-bsv-auth-version`**: The BRC-103 version string (e.g. `"1.0"`).  
2. **`x-bsv-auth-identity-key`**: The sender’s public identity key (33-byte compressed secp256k1 pubkey, typically hex).  
3. **`x-bsv-auth-nonce`** & **`x-bsv-auth-your-nonce`**: 32-byte ephemeral nonces used in BRC-103’s handshake.  
4. **`x-bsv-auth-signature`**: ECDSA signature in hex, verifying the message.  
5. **`x-bsv-auth-request-id`**: A client-generated 32-byte random ID (base64) to correlate request/response pairs in “general” messages.  
6. **`x-bsv-auth-message-type`**: (Optional) The BRC-103 message type if returning a certificateRequest or certificateResponse via HTTP.  
7. **`x-bsv-auth-requested-certificates`**: (Optional) JSON-encoded `RequestedCertificateSet` for certificate requests.  

**`x-bsv-auth-`** headers **MUST** be excluded from the set of user-signed headers. They are ephemeral parameters or are used for BRC-103 signature itself.

### 6.3 Signed Fields & Excluded Fields

When building a “general” message, the BRC-103 specification requires a **signature** across certain fields. In BRC-104:

- **Included in signature**:
  - Request method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.).  
  - Request path and query string.  
  - “Whitelisted” headers only:
    - **`authorization`** (client and server)
    - **`content-type`** (client-only)
    - Any header with prefix **`x-bsv-`** except `x-bsv-auth-...`  
  - Request body bytes.

- **Excluded**:
  - Non-whitelisted headers (like `x-bsv-auth-*`, `accept`)  
  - Cookies, user-agent, etc.

Servers do not sign content-type because certain server middleware tends to modify the content-type header.
For example, express appends charset=utf-8 to the content-type resulting in ambiguity over the pre-image being signed.

Clients however do not generally modify the content-type header in requests which allows it to be included in the pre-image being signed.

The **order** of included headers will be lexicographical to ensure matching preimages on both sides.

### 6.4 Request/Response Flow for “General” Messages

**Client perspective**:

1. **Construct** an HTTP request as usual, but store the entire method, path, query, selected headers, and body inside a “payload” field in the BRC-103 general message.  
2. The BRC-103 identity key, version, nonce, etc., go into `x-bsv-auth-*` headers.  
3. Send the request over standard HTTP.  
4. The server verifies authenticity, processes the request, and **returns** a BRC-103 “general” message in the response:
   - The server includes `x-bsv-auth-version`, `x-bsv-auth-signature`, `x-bsv-auth-identity-key`, etc.  
   - The actual response status code, headers, and body are re-encoded as a “payload.”  

**Server perspective**:

1. On receiving the request, parse the `x-bsv-auth-*` headers (nonce, signature, identityKey, etc.).  
2. Construct the “general” BRC-103 message from the payload.  
3. If signature checks pass, handle the HTTP request **in memory** (similar to a normal route).  
4. Instead of sending the result directly to the wire, embed your final status code, headers, and body in a new “general” BRC-103 message.  
5. Write it back in `x-bsv-auth-*` headers + the binary payload within the same HTTP response.

### 6.5 Request/Response Flow for “Non-General” Messages

**Non-general** BRC-103 messages—like `initialRequest`, `initialResponse`, `certificateRequest`, `certificateResponse`—**MUST** be exchanged via:

1. `POST /.well-known/auth`, with a JSON body:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.0",
     "messageType": "initialRequest",
     "identityKey": "...",
     "initialNonce": "...",
     "signature": "...",
     ...
   }
   ```
2. The server decodes the AuthMessage, verifies it, and possibly replies with another **AuthMessage** in JSON form:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "1.0",
     "messageType": "initialResponse",
     "identityKey": "...",
     "nonce": "...",
     "yourNonce": "...",
     "signature": "...",
     ...
   }
   ```
3. On success, the client merges that result into the BRC-103 session state.

### 6.6 Authentication Failure Handling

- If the handshake or signature fails, the server **MUST** return `401 Unauthorized` (or another 4xx suitable code) with a JSON body describing the error.  
- If the user sets invalid data, the server **MAY** respond with `400 Bad Request`.  

### 6.7 General Message Encoding Rules

When sending a “general” message:

#### 6.7.1 Path Encoding Rules

- If the `path` has a value, it must be serialized as UTF-8 bytes with a length prefix.  
- If the `path` is empty, it must default to `/`, serialized as UTF-8 bytes with a length prefix.

#### 6.7.2 Query Parameter Encoding Rules

- If query parameters are present, the entire query string (including the leading `?`) must be serialized as UTF-8 bytes with a length prefix.  
- If no query parameters are present, specify a length of `-1` in the payload.

#### 6.7.3 Body Encoding Rules

The **body** is included raw in the BRC-103 payload, but **only** after a length prefix.

a. If the `content-type` is `application/json`:  
   - The JSON object must be stringified and converted to UTF-8 bytes.  
   - If the body is empty, an empty JSON object `{}` should be stringified and converted to UTF-8 bytes.  

b. If the body consists of binary data (e.g. images):  
   - The binary is included directly as bytes.  
   - If the body is empty, specify a length of `-1` in the payload.

The same rules apply to the server’s response body in a “general” response message.

### 6.8 Signature Preimage Calculation for HTTP Request Messages

BRC-103 specifies that the preimage is constructed by concatenating these fields in a fixed order:

1. `x-bsv-auth-request-id` (32 bytes, base64-decoded).  
2. Request method: length + UTF-8 bytes.  
3. Path: length + UTF-8 bytes (use `/` if the path is empty).  
4. Query string (including `?`): length + UTF-8 bytes (or `-1` if none).  
5. **Included headers**: count them in the order they are transmitted. For each header:  
   - VarInt of key length, followed by key bytes  
   - VarInt of value length, followed by value bytes  
6. Body: length + body bytes (or `-1` if none).

Finally, sign the preimage using the identity key. The server reconstructs the same preimage from the request data and verifies the signature contained in `x-bsv-auth-signature`.

### 6.9 Signature Preimage Calculation for HTTP Response Messages

In response to client request the server creates a BRC-103 payload as follows:

1. `x-bsv-auth-request-id` (echoing back the client's requestId as seen on line 174).  
2. Response status (varInt)
3. **Included headers** count, given in order of transmittal over the wire. For each header:
   - VarInt of key length, key bytes
   - VarInt of value length, value bytes  
4. Body length + body bytes (or `-1` if none).

## 7. Implementation Notes & Examples

### 7.1 Client-Side Example

A reference “client” does the following:

- When sending a **non-general** message (e.g. handshake, certificate request), it:
  1. Performs `POST /.well-known/auth` with `Content-Type: application/json`.
  2. Embeds the entire AuthMessage (BRC-103 structure) in JSON.  
- When sending a **general** message:
  1. Serializes method, path, query, whitelisted headers, and body into a BRC-103 payload.  
  2. Supplies `x-bsv-auth-version`, `x-bsv-auth-identity-key`, `x-bsv-auth-nonce`, `x-bsv-auth-your-nonce` (if applicable), `x-bsv-auth-signature`, and `x-bsv-auth-request-id` in the request headers.  
  3. On receiving the server’s HTTP response, decodes those same fields from the response headers, building a BRC-103 message that includes the returned status code, headers, and body as a “payload.”  

### 7.2 Server-Side Example

1. Intercept `POST /.well-known/auth` requests, parse them as JSON, treat them as BRC-103 “non-general.”  
2. For other paths, it checks for `x-bsv-auth-request-id` to see if it’s a “general” message.  
3. It re-routes the normal Express request logic so that instead of returning data directly, the server packs the data into a BRC-103 “general” message and responds accordingly.  

This approach ensures a typical server can remain mostly unmodified, while the middleware handles the signature verification and re-encoding of the final response.

## 8. Security Considerations

- **Replay Attacks**: The `nonce` fields in BRC-103 ensure freshness. Servers **MUST** reject repeated nonces.  
- **Header Injection**: Only a fixed set of headers is signed. If malicious headers are injected, they are outside the signature scope. Implementers should sanitize or ignore unknown headers.  
- **Transport Encryption**: BRC-104 does **not** replace TLS. Implementers SHOULD still use HTTPS to hide private or sensitive information from eavesdroppers.  
- **Certificate Revocation**: If identity certificates are used, the logic for checking revocationOutpoints remains as in BRC-103.
