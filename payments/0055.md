# BRC-55: HTTPS Transport Mechanism for DPP

## Abstract

BRC-27 defines an abstract messaging protocol that facilitates payments on the Bitcoin SV network. This specification extends the protocol with the specifics required for a concrete HTTPS implementation that includes message size limits and HTTPS-specific implementation details.

## Motivation

HTTPS is one of the most widely used transport mechanisms for internet traffic. Enabling users of HTTPS to benefit from the use of the [BRC-27](./0027.md) DPP will facilitate increased industry adoption and growth. Defining implementation-specific stipulations for HTTPS-based DPP will address problems and ambiguities specific to this communications substrate.

## Specification

Below is the table with messages requested from client (wallet) to merchant (server).

The `paymentID` parameter is assumed to be known as a result of request between client-server before DPP protocol operation.

MESSAGE | ENDPOINTS | TYPE/SUBTYPE | RESPONSE CODES
--------|-----------|--------------|-----------------
PaymentTerms | GET `/api/v1/payment/{paymentID}` | application/json | 200 – contains PaymentTerms JSON object with all data used by the payee to construct a transaction <br /> 404 – returned if the paymentID has not been found <br /> 500 – returned if there is an unexpected internal error
Payment | POST `/api/v1/payment/{paymentID}` | application/json | 201 – contains PaymentACK JSON object <br /> 400 – returned if the user input is invalid, usually an issue with the paymentID <br /> 404 – returned if the paymentID has not been found 500 – returned if there is an unexpected internal error

PaymentTerms messages larger than 10 MB should be rejected by the wallet application, to mitigate denial-of-service attacks.

Payment messages larger than 10 MB should be rejected by the payment host’s server, to mitigate denial-of-service attacks.

PaymentACK messages larger than 11 MB bytes should be rejected by the wallet application, to mitigate denial-of-service attacks. This is larger than the limits on Payment and PaymentTerms messages as PaymentACK contains a full Payment message within it.

## Implementations

The BRC-55 API is implemented [in this example from Jad Wahab](https://jadwahab.github.io/direct-payment-protocol/#/).
