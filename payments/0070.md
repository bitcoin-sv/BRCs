# BRC-69: Paymail Receieve BEEF

Deggen (deggen@kschw.com)

## Abstract

We specify a paymail capability extension which supports the passing of BEEF Transactions between hosts. The procedure for service discovery and requesting outputs is not detailed, rather this proposal contains only a recommendation to replace [BRC-12 RawTx](../transactions/0012.md) hex data with [BRC-62 BEEF](../transactions/0062.md) hex data.

## Motivation

We propose that [p2p destination and receive raw transaction](./0028.md) functionality between hosts to include the data required for the counterparty to run SPV on the transaction.


## BRFCID

A random ID was generated in order to avoid label collisions in the capability document of a paymail server.

``` yaml
brfcid: 5c55a7fdb7bb
title: Background Evaluation Extended Format Transaction
author: Darren Kellenschwiler
version: 1.0.0
```

## Specification

We specify that an endpoint for delivery of transaction data ought to be added to the capabilities object in the .well-known response of a paymail service with the label: `5c55a7fdb7bb`.

``` json
<!-- capabilities document of the host -->
{
    "capabilities": {
        "5c55a7fdb7bb": "https://paymail.domain.tld/api/v1/beef/{alias}@{domain.tld}",
        <!-- ...others -->
    }
}
```

#### Client Request

The sender must replace the `{alias}` and `{domain.tld}` placeholders in the URI template provided by `capabilities.5c55a7fdb7bb` with a valid Paymail handle. The client must then perform a POST HTTP request with the following body:

```json
{
  "beef": "<beef_transaction_hex>", <!-- note the label is different >
  "metadata": {
    "sender": "<sender_paymail>",
    "pubkey": "<sender_public_key>",
    "signature": "<signature_of_txid>",
    "note": "<optional_human_readable_note>"
  },
  "reference": "<payment_reference>"
}
```

BEEF transaction hex is a string encoding of the binary format detailed in [BRC-62](../transactions/0062.md).

#### Server Response

The server must validate the transaction and respond with the accepted transaction ID and an optional human-readable note.

```json
{
  "txid": "<accepted_txid>",
  "note": "<optional_human_readable_note>"
}
```
