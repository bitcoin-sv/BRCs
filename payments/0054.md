# BRC-54: Hybrid Payment Mode for DPP

## Abstract

The core DPP protocol has been defined by [BRC-27](./0027.md), but it is useless without at least one mode to facilitate payments. We present the Hybrid Payment Mode: a flexible and open-ended payment mode that facilitates payment with BSV as well as tokens.
