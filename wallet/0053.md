# BRC-53: Certificate Creation and Revelation

Ty Everett (ty@projectbabbage.com)

## Abstract

We define methods for an application to request that a wallet create and prove [BRC-52](../peer-to-peer/0052.md) identity certificates. We define a set of additional messages that extend the [BRC-1](../wallet/0001.md) application-to-wallet messaging layer with this functionality. We specify the functionality to be performed by the wallet as part of these processes, including a standard methodology for wallets to contact identity certificate certifiers over HTTP and carry out the signing of these documents. To keep users in control over how their data is processed and used, we allow for the wallet to obtain user consent prior to carrying out these operations.

## Motivation

BRC-52 takes a privacy-first and flexible approach to user identity certificates, but applications need a way to create and prove these certificates as part of their operation.
