# BRC-99: P Baskets: Allowing Future Wallet Basket and Digital Asset Permission Schemes

Ty Everett (ty@projectbabbage.com)

## Abstract

The [BRC-46](../wallet/0046.md) architecture for digital assets stored within wallet baskets enables a wide range of use cases. However, it lacks support for more than a rudimentary permission system. Wallets can grant applications blanket access to basketed assets or deny access entirely, but cannot make decisions based on specific assets, their output scripts, or tokenized values they represent. To support the future development of new permission schemes covering fungible and non-fungible digital assets within wallets, we propose reserving certain basket identifiers to prevent their use by applications and ensure compatibility with future standards.

## Motivation

The motivation for this proposal is to future-proof the [BRC-46](../wallet/0046.md) architecture by enabling the seamless integration of new permission schemes applicable to assets stored in or retrieved from wallet-managed UTXO baskets. By specifying reserved identifiers, new security and permission paradigms can be implemented without conflicts or unintended behavior.

## Specification

To accommodate future basket permission schemes, wallets must reject any operation requests made under basket IDs that begin with `p ` (a lowercase “p” followed by a space).

### Future Scheme Identifiers

Future permission schemes may define their own ID formats, adhering to the following constraints:

- The scheme ID must not contain spaces.
- The basket ID format should begin with `p `, followed by the scheme ID, a space, and the rest of the basket identifier.

#### Example Format

A basket ID such as `p dollarToken xxxxx` might represent a specific token type (e.g., tokenized dollars), where:

- `p ` indicates an alternative permission scheme is being utilized for the basket.
- `dollarTokan` is the identifier for the permission scheme.
- `xxxxx` is the basket ID under the alternative scheme.

#### Basket ID Parsing and Rules

Wallets must be capable of differentiating between standard and alternative permission schemes by identifying the `p ` prefix followed by the scheme ID. The scheme ID itself must be distinct and must not contain spaces to ensure unambiguous parsing.

Upon recognizing a basket ID structured as `p <scheme ID> <rest of the ID>`, wallets may apply the specific rules defined by the scheme associated with the `scheme ID`. These rules could define:

- Constraints based on specific locking scripts or script templates of UTXOs
- The conditions under which operations can be executed
- Mechanisms for allowing applications to access only a certain set number of only a specific asset type, according to the rules of some tokenization protocol, overlay service or script template
- Specific counterparty requirements and other customizable permission attributes

### Reserved Structure

To maintain clarity and prevent conflicts:

- Any basket ID starting with `p ` must be reserved for future use.
- Wallets must refuse operations involving basket IDs beginning with `p ` unless they explicitly support the defined scheme ID.
- A space must immediately follow the scheme ID to demarcate it from rest of the basket ID.

### Extensibility Beyond Current Paradigms

This specification enables future permission schemes to extend beyond the current, rudamentary blanket access-or-deny-all model contemplated by BRCs 46 and 73. This flexibility supports innovative designs in wallet permissions that adapt to evolving user and application needs.

For example, a wallet could allow access to a maximum of 10 dollars of tokenized fiat money per month within an application.

## Conclusion

By reserving basket IDs that start with `p ` and specifying rules for future permission schemes, we enable forward compatibility and robust support for expanded wallet permission functionalities. This ensures that new schemes can be integrated without disrupting existing applications or creating parsing ambiguities.
