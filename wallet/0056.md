## Abstract

The importance of a standard interface by which Bitcoin applications can communicate with wallets and underlying infrastructure cannot be overstated. We propose an identity interface facilitating the creation of Bitcoin transactions, the use of user-held keys for encryption and digital signatures, and the employment of identity certificates to authenticate users with their counterparties. We set a baseline standard and create a versioning system that facilitates continued expansion and extensibility over time.

## Motivation

Computing has long been subject to shortfalls in the areas of information centralization and architectural cross-compatibility. Users on the internet struggle with complex and insecure authentication systems which leave them vulnerable and leak their data. Websites rely on advertising to monetize their offerings, but ads warp the incentives of platforms and creators in ways that ultimately harm everyone involved. By defining a standard interface by which users can identify themselves, protect their data and engage in e-commerce with Bitcoin, this standard offers a solution to problems that have long plagued the existing model.

## Specification

We specify a baseline standard for an abstract messaging layer which facilitates an identity interface between an application and an underlying MetaNet Client. As part of this messaging layer, we incorporate various message types defined by other BRC standards:

- **BRC-1:** We incorporate by reference the message types relating to Bitcoin transaction creation as specified by BRC-1. This facilitates micropayment-based interactions as part of applications, enabling new monetization models that are not subject to the same problematic incentives as internet-based advertising.

- **BRC-2:** We incorporate by reference the message types relating to encryption as specified by BRC-2. This facilitates user privacy and provides a secure foundation for user-to-user communication, enabling applications which protect privacy to emerge and gain traction.

- **BRC-3:** We incorporate by reference the message types relating to digital signatures as specified by BRC-3. This facilitates generalized message sender attestation and endorsement, solving problems such as fake AI-generated content by allowing relevant parties or the entire world to check whether something has been endorsed by its purported originator.

- **BRC-4:** We incorporate by reference the extension to BRC-1 as defined by BRC-4, providing for the consumption and utilization of arbitrary UTXO-based Bitcoin tokens as part of transactions. This facilitates the creation and transfer between users of tokenized assets without restrictions beyond those set by their respective output locking scripts.

- **BRC-46:** We incorporate by reference the extension to BRC-1 as defined by BRC-46, providing for the tracking and management of Bitcoin UTXOs in baskets. This facilitates the storage and retrieval of single-party tokens and digital assets in the user's wallet while removing the need to rely on a single trusted application for asset management.

- **BRC-50:** We incorporate by reference the message types relating to incoming transaction submission as specified by BRC-50, ensuring users have a way to receive funds into their wallets from within applications. This gives them a way to receive payment for the value they create as part of their interactions within applications.

- **BRC-53:** We incorporate by reference the message types relating to digital identity certificate creation and revelation, as specified by BRC-53. This provides a way for users to maintain and selectively reveal their identities with specific counterparties in the digital world, facilitating an increased level of trust and accountability.

With these core components in place, we are left only with the need to specify a few other messages that are necessary to facilitate versioning, user network checking and user-to-wallet authentication status discovery. We now proceed to the specification of those auxiliary messages.

### HMACs

The addition of HMACs are the most significant addition aside from the core message types. HMACs facilitate authenticating messages sent between users, and are generally useful for a wide range of applications.

#### **HMAC Creation Request**

To initiate an HMAC creation request, the message request must contain the following fields:

Field        | Description
------------ | ---------------
data         | The data to HMAC. If given as a string, it must be in base64 format.
protocolID   | An identifier for the protocol under which this operation is being performed.
keyID        | An identifier for the message. During verification, the same message ID will be required. This can be used to prevent key re-use, even when the same user is using the same protocol to HMAC multiple messages.
counterparty | If specified, the user with this identity key will also be able to verify the HMAC, as long as they specify the current user's identity key as their counterparty. Must be a hexadecimal string representing a 33-byte or 65-byte value, "self" or "anyone".

The response should be the SHA-256 HMAC of the data provided given as a Buffer.

#### **HMAC Verification Request**

To verify data according to a specific protocol, key, and counterparty, we define that a verification request should contain the following fields:

Field        | Description
------------ | --------------------------------------------
data         | The data to verify. If given as a string, it must be in base64 format.
hmac         | The hmac created from the data. If given as a string, it must be in base64 format.
protocolID   | Specify an identifier for the protocol under which the HMAC operation was performed.
keyID        | An identifier for the message. This should be the same message ID that was used when creating the HMAC.
counterparty | If specified, allows verification where the user with this identity key has created the HMAC, as long as they had specified the current user's identity key as their counterparty during creation. Must be a hexadecimal string representing a 33-byte or 65-byte value or "self". Note that signatures created with counterparty = "anyone" are verifiable by anyone, and do not need user keys through the kernel. (optional, default self)

### Public Key and Certificate Retrieval

Facilitating access to public keys and certificates are a crucial part of the wallet messaging layer as they provide the necessary components for identity verification. [BRC-43](../key-derivation/0043.md) is used for defining the protocolID and keyID formats, and [BRC-52](../peer-to-peer/0052.md) defines the format of certificates requested.

#### **Public Key Request**

To request a public key, we define the following standard request fields:

Field           | Description
--------------- | -----------------
protocolID      | An identifier for the protocol under which this operation is being performed.
keyID           |  An identifier for retrieving the public key used. This can be used to prevent key re-use, even when the same user is using the same protocol to perform actions.
identityKey     | If true, the identity key will be returned, and no key derivation will be performed (optional, default false)
counterparty    | The counterparty to use for derivation. If provided, derives a public key for this counterparty, who can derive the corresponding private key. (optional, default self)
forSelf         | Whether the derived child public key corresponds to a private key held by the current user. (optional, default false)

#### **Certificate List Request**

To request a list of certificates belonging to the user, we define these standard request fields:

Field           | Description
--------------- | -----------------
certifiers      | The certifiers to filter certificates by
types           | The certificate types to filter certificates by, given as an object whose keys are types and whose values are arrays of fields to request from certificates of the given type.

### Network, Versioning and Authentication

Another important aspect of the wallet messaging layer is allowing applications the ability to check which Bitcoin network is in use, and whether or not a user has been authenticated.

#### **Bitcoin Network Request**

To determine which Bitcoin network a user's MetaNet Client is currently using, applications can make requests to a standardized endpoint to ensure compatibility. 

We define that the request has no parameters and simply returns a string of either `"test"` or `"main"` indicating the current network in use.

#### **MetaNet Client Version Request**

We define the standard client version request to contain no parameters and to simply return the version of the MetaNet Client in use as a string.

Ex. `"0.3.49"`

#### **Authentication Status Request**

The authentication status request requires no parameters and returns a boolean indicating whether the current user is authenticated or not.

#### **Asynchronous Authentication Request**

The asynchronous authentication request requires no parameters and waits until the user is authenticated before returning a response of true.

## Implementations

The completed BRC-56 abstract messaging layer has been implemented by the [Babbage SDK](https://github.com/p2ppsr/babbage-sdk).
