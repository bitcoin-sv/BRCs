# BRC-97: Extensible Proof-Type Format for Specific Key Linkage Claims

Ty Everett (ty@projectbabbage.com)

## Abstract

This BRC proposes an extensible format for including zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) in specific key linkage revelations as per [BRC-69](../key-derivation/0069.md) Method 2. While [BRC-94](../key-derivation/0094.md) addresses limitations of [BRC-69](../key-derivation/0069.md) Method 1 through a Schnorr-based ZKP, there is currently no standardized method for provable specific key linkage claims in Method 2. Given the rapid evolution of ZKP technologies, this specification introduces a proof type enumeration scheme to accommodate future proof mechanisms. By defining a flexible proof type field, we allow for the inclusion of various ZKP schemes as they become available, ensuring that wallets and applications can adopt and support them over time, eventually converging on standardized formats.

## Motivation

We aim to provide a method for proving specific key linkage revelations under [BRC-69](../key-derivation/0069.md) Method 2. However, current ZKP techniques may not fully support this requirement, as these technologies are still maturing. This proposal allows us to proceed with standardizing wallet interactions and linkage proofs while accommodating future advancements in ZKP capabilities. By introducing an extensible proof type field, we create a flexible mechanism for integrating new proof schemes as they emerge, fostering innovation and facilitating eventual convergence on standard proofs.

## Scope and Assumptions

This specification focuses on proofs of a specific computation: that a prover (Alice) has computed a shared secret between herself and a counterparty (Bob), and used it as a SHA-256-HMAC key over a defined invoice number to derive a specific linkage offset value. The approach is constrained to non-interactive proof schemes, as interactive proofs are impractical for our use case.

We make the following assumptions:

1. **Non-Interactive Proofs**: Only non-interactive proof schemes are considered, as per existing standards like [STARKs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046.pdf).
2. **External Verification**: Proof verification is expected to be performed by external systems or verifiers, not within the wallet itself.
3. **Encrypted Proof Payloads**: Proof payloads are encrypted according to [BRC-72](../key-derivation/0072.md) to ensure confidentiality during transmission.

## Specification

### Integration with Existing Standards

We build on the existing standards:

- **[BRC-69](../key-derivation/0069.md)**: Defines methods for revealing key linkages.
- **[BRC-72](../key-derivation/0072.md)**: Specifies encryption of linkage information in transit using [BRC-2](../wallet/0002.md).
- **[BRC-94](../key-derivation/0094.md)**: Provides a Schnorr-based ZKP for counterparty-level linkage revelation (Method 1).

This proposal extends these standards by defining an extensible proof type format for specific key linkage claims (Method 2).

### Proof Encryption with BRC-72

All proofs are encrypted using the mechanism defined in [BRC-72](../key-derivation/0072.md).

- **Counterparty-Level Revelations**: Encrypted according to BRC-72, including both the shared secret and the Schnorr proof as per [BRC-94](../key-derivation/0094.md).
- **Specific Key Revelations**: Encrypted according to BRC-72, including the linkage offset and the proof payload defined herein.

### Proof Formats

#### Counterparty-Level Proof Format (BRC-94)

We define a binary format for the encrypted Schnorr proof payload for counterparty-level revelations:

| **Field** | **Bytes** | **Description**                                                  |
| --------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `R`       | 33        | Nonce public key point `R` in compressed 33-byte DER format.     |
| `S'`      | 33        | Nonce shared secret point `S'` in compressed 33-byte DER format. |
| `z`       | Variable  | Response scalar `z` as a big-endian integer.                     |

This binary data is concatenated in the above order, then encrypted as per [BRC-72](../key-derivation/0072.md) alongside the shared secret, and returned by the wallet to the verifier.

#### Specific Key Proof Format (BRC-97)

We define a binary format for the encrypted payload for specific key linkage proofs:

| **Field**    | **Bytes** | **Description**                                                      |
| ------------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Proof Type` | 1         | One-byte unsigned integer (0-255), indicating the proof scheme used. |
| `Proof`      | Variable  | Proof payload, format depends on `Proof Type`.                       |

This binary data is assembled by first specifying the `Proof Type`, followed by the `Proof` payload (if applicable), then encrypted as per [BRC-72](../key-derivation/0072.md) alongside the specific linkage offset, and returned by the wallet to the verifier.

### Proof Type Enumeration

We introduce a proof type numbering scheme:

- **Proof Type 0**: Indicates no proof is provided. Verifiers must trust the prover when the proof type is zero. The `Proof` payload is empty.
- **Proof Types 1-255**: Reserved for future proof schemes. As new ZKP methods become available, they can be assigned unique proof type identifiers within this range, along with their specific proof formats.

### Example: Proof Type Zero

When `Proof Type` is zero:

- The `Proof` payload is empty.
- The verifier receives the encrypted linkage offset but must trust the prover's claim, as there's no way to independently verify the correctness without a proof.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Wallet and Application Behavior

- **Wallets**: Should implement the ability to generate and include the `Proof Type` and `Proof` payload in the encrypted data when performing specific key linkage revelations.
- **Verifiers**: Should be able to parse the `Proof Type` field and handle the `Proof` payload accordingly, based on supported proof schemes.

### Future-Proofing

- As new ZKP methods are developed and standardized, new BRCs can define additional proof types (1-255) and their corresponding proof formats.
- Wallets and verifiers should be designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new proof types without significant changes to underlying architectures.

### Security Considerations

- **Confidentiality**: All proof payloads must be encrypted as per [BRC-72](../key-derivation/0072.md) to ensure that sensitive linkage information is protected during transit.
- **Trust**: When using Proof Type 0 (no proof), verifiers must be aware that they are relying on the prover's honesty, as no independent verification is possible.

## Future Work

Future specifications may define new proof types (1-255) along with their proof formats and verification methods. Potential avenues include:

- **Proof Type 1**: Could be assigned to a specific ZKP scheme (e.g., Bulletproofs, STARKs, SNARKs) that is suitable for proving specific key linkage claims.
- **Standardization**: As the ecosystem converges on preferred proof schemes, updates to this BRC can formalize these proofs, promoting interoperability.

## Conclusion

This BRC provides a flexible and extensible framework for including proof schemes in specific key linkage revelations, accommodating future advancements in ZKP technology. By standardizing the proof type field, we enable wallets and applications to adopt new proof mechanisms as they emerge, facilitating independent verification of specific key linkage claims while maintaining backward compatibility and fostering innovation in the BSV blockchain ecosystem.
