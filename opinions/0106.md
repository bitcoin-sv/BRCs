# BRC-0106: Zero-Friction, Mobile-First Onboarding for MetaNet-Enabled Apps

Crumbs (op@rarepepe.club)

## Abstract
A zero-friction onboarding protocol optimized for mobile-first metanet enabled user experiences. Temporary key generation enables instant access without sign-up; standardized UI components facilitate seamless export of keys and cross-app communication while preserving usability across devices. Secondly it mandates clear contextual communication of the benefits of uniquely blockchain enabled features, so users understand *why* persistence matters at the right moments during their learning curve.

---

## Motivation
MetaNet-enabled applications fail if users cannot immediately perceive utility. Conventional onboarding flows (downloads, signups, verification) create friction and deter adoption. Allowing immediate engagement via temporary keys, mobile-first UX, and contextual communication of blockchain value improves retention and adoption of wallets, encourages certification over multiple sessions, and through it long-term participation.

## Specification

### 1. Temporary Key Generation
- On initial visit, apps **MUST** generate temporary keys asynchronously.
- Key generation **MUST** complete within **0.5 s**; otherwise, users **MUST** be allowed to browse placeholder data until ready.
- Delays beyond 0.1 s interrupt flow; beyond 1 s break task continuity ([NN/g: Response Times](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/)).

### 2. Immediate Access and Deferred Onboarding
- Users **MUST** access core features without sign-up, download, or authentication.
- Users typically leave within 10â€“20 s unless value is instantly clear ([NN/g: How Long Do Users Stay on Web Pages?](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/)).
- Temporary keys **MUST** unlock a subset of functionality.
- Apps **MUST NOT** enforce explicit onboarding (tutorials, forced walkthroughs) before core functionality is visible ([NN/g: Mobile App Onboarding](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mobile-app-onboarding/)).

### 3. Mobile-First, Responsive Design
- Apps **MUST** be designed mobile-first: prioritize small-screen usability (touch targets, minimal UI) before adapting for desktop.
- Responsive design **MUST** prevent content dispersion or degraded usability on larger devices ([NN/g: Content Dispersion](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/content-dispersion/), [Baymard: Mobile UX](https://baymard.com/blog/mobile-ux-ecommerce)).

### 4. Optional Persistence via Standard Banner
- Apps **MUST NOT** force key saving during first sessions.
- Apps **MUST** display a standardized, dismissible banner (configurable top/bottom).
- Banner **MUST** include:
  - A link/button to export or onboard.
  - A permanent **"What is this?"** link.
- The **"What is this?"** link **MUST** open a drawer with a one-paragraph explanation of:
  - What MetaNet is.
  - How this app uses it.
  - Which features require persistence, and why.
  - Which features do not.

### 5. Standardized Export Screen
- Accessible via the banner, this screen **MUST**:
  - Provide clear export instructions.
  - Enable one-click export to supported MetaNet wallets.
  - Show a neutral, curated list of compliant wallets.
- Wallets **MUST** implement compatible import functionality.

### 6. Feature Disclosure and Blockchain Value Communication
- Apps **MUST** clearly indicate which features require persistent keys, MetaNet certificates, or social certificates.
- Apps **MUST** communicate the **unique benefits of blockchain usage** *in context*:
  - When identity persistence enables social reputation, explain that benefit at the point of use.
  - When immutability or micropayments enable a feature, explain it where the user invokes that feature.
- Explanations **MUST** emphasize user benefit over technical detail in maximum two lines of paragraph text.
- Research shows abstract explanations fail; users only retain information when given at the moment of relevance ([NN/g: Contextual Help](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/contextual-help/), [Baymard: Accounts & Self-Service](https://baymard.com/blog/current-state-accounts-selfservice)).

### 7. Cross-App Communication
- Temporary users **MUST** be able to communicate across MetaNet apps with other temporary and certified users in real time.
- Apps **MUST** show total network-wide online users.
- Identified users (with social certs) **MUST** be distinguishable.
- Identified users **MUST** be able to mute or apply a "trolltoll" to unidentified users or opt-out from being visible across metanet apps.

---

## Implementations
- Standardized banner guidelines. (placement, style, dismissibility, "What is this?" drawer).
- Mobile-first design approach strongly encouraged for all metanet enabled apps, validated with NN/g and Baymard heuristics.
- IRC-style communication overlay that allows temporary and certified users to communicate and troubleshoot across metanet enabled apps.
- Export/import flows tested across multiple wallets.
- Contextual tooltips and inline hints that describe blockchain-backed benefits in plain language at the point of use.
- Emphasize in-app value unlocked via persistence at the right moment of the user journey.
