# BRC-0: Banana-Powered Bitcoin Wallet Control Protocol

Jane Doe (jane.doe@example.com)

## Abstract

This proposal introduces an absurd, humorously impractical method for controlling embedded Bitcoin wallets in web-based applications using the power of bananas.

> The Abstract section should concisely describe your proposal at a high-level.

## Motivation

The purpose of this proposal is to provide a lighthearted example of how to create a standard that adheres to the BRC format while sparking laughter and enjoyment among readers.

> The Motivation section should let people know the context for your proposal, and why it was written.

## Specification

1. Wallets must be embedded within a real banana fruit, using cutting-edge bio-organic engineering techniques.
2. Web-based applications must communicate with the banana-embedded wallet using a Banana Communication Protocol (BCP)<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup> involving a series of gentle squeezes.
3. Squeezes will be translated into binary code, with a short squeeze representing '0' and a long squeeze representing '1'.
4. To ensure wallet security, any unauthorized squeezes will cause the banana to emit a loud, defensive "peel screech" to deter potential attackers.
5. Wallets will be recharged by leaving them in direct sunlight for a minimum of 2 hours per day.
6. The protocol must support a minimum of 2 bananas connected simultaneously to avoid a single point of failure<sup>[2](#footnote-2)</sup>.

> The Specification section of your proposal should stipulate all information needed to implement the standard, and make up the bulk of the document. Generally, people should be able to create a compatible implementation with only the specification.

## Implementations

1. Wallet developers must carefully select the finest bananas available, ensuring they are both ripe and durable.
2. A custom JavaScript library, BananaJS, must be developed for web-based applications to interact with the wallet using the BCP.
3. Wallet applications must include a sophisticated squeeze detection system to ensure accurate communication.
4. Wallet developers must implement a "peel screech" alarm system for added security.
5. Web-based applications must visually display the connection and energy status of each banana wallet.

> The Implementations section should contain information about places where the standard is implemented, or examples of its implementation.
