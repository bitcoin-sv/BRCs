# BRC-10: Merkle proof standardised format

## Abstract

This BRC serves as a reference point for the TSC Merkle Proof Standardized Format. It is identified as BRC-10 and is used to avoid ambiguity in referring to the TSC standard, just like other proposals like BRC-11 (which revise or extend this proposal) are referenced by their BRC numbers.

## Motivation

To avoid ambiguity in referring to the TSC Merkle Proof Standardized Format, it is important to have a specific identifier. The use of BRC-10 as a reference point allows for clear and unambiguous communication among developers and the community. The BRC-10 designation is similar to other proposals, such as [BRC-32](../key-derivation/0032.md), which are also referenced by their BRC numbers.

## Specification

You can read the TSC standard [on the website](https://tsc.bitcoinassociation.net/standards/merkle-proof-standardised-format/).

## Discussion

As with any other BRC, feel free to open issues in the BRC repository that discuss extensions of BRC-10.
