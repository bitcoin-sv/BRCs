# Graph Aware Sync Protocol

Ragnar Friedman <ragnar.friedman@proton.me>

## Abstract
GASP is designed to synchronize transaction data between two parties in a blockchain environment. It ensures the legitimacy and completeness of transaction data using a recursive reconciliation method.

## Participants
- **Alice**: Initiates the sync process.
- **Bob**: Responds and participates in the sync process.

## Protocol Steps

1. **Initialization**
   - Alice starts by sending a bloom filter containing all current spendable TXID+VOUTs as elements.

2. **Receiving and Building List**
   - Bob receives the filter and builds a list of his items that are not members of the set.

3. **Transaction Verification**
   - Bob sends an INV (Inventory) message to Alice for each item not in the set.
   - The INV includes:
     - Output, transaction, and associated merkle proof.
     - Any metadata (such as labels, descriptions, or local timestamps) associated with transactions or outputs.
     - A list of VOUTs spent by its inputs and associated metadata hashes.
     - The preimage for each hash, including all metadata and the merkle proof or broadcast response.

4. **Alice's Response**
   - For each INV, Alice responds with a list of input transactions she does not know about.
   - If Alice has the transaction but the metadata hash differs, she requests updated metadata.
   - If Alice lacks the transaction, she requests the entire transaction.

5. **Recursive Transaction Sync**
   - Bob responds to Alice's requests with an INV containing the encompassing transaction, done recursively.
     - When including the full transaction, all metadata is provided.
     - When only metadata is included, it encompasses the list of spent VOUTs and associated metadata hashes.

6. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - In case of errors, affected transactions are ignored and not synced.
   - If errors prevent a party from fully anchoring transactions back to the blockchain, these transactions are ignored.
   - Failures experienced by one party are not communicated to the other due to the declaratory nature of the protocol.

7. **Finalization of Sync**
   - The process continues until there are no more INVs for Bob to send.
   - Once complete, all of Bob's records are considered synced with Alice.

8. **Role Reversal**
   - The roles reverse, with Bob sending Alice a bloom filter.
   - The parties then exchange data in the other direction, following the same steps.

## Security Measures
- Verification of merkle proofs and the longest chain of block headers.
- Recursively requesting information until all inputs are fully proven.
- Invalidating transactions that cannot be linked back to a valid proof.

## Notes
- The protocol is adaptable to various blockchain environments.
- The recursive nature ensures thorough and complete data synchronization.
- The protocol emphasizes security, efficiency, and data integrity.

## Conclusion
GASP offers a robust and secure method for synchronizing transaction data between parties in a blockchain network, leveraging recursive data exchange and thorough verification mechanisms.
