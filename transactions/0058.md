# BRC-58: Merkle Path Data Model

## Abstract
We present a data model and JSON format for a Merkle Path which will be passed from a Transaction Lookup service to a Lite Client via web API.

## Motivation

[BRC-10](../0010.md) otherwise known as the TSC Merkle Proof Standardized Format has a few competing ideas baked into it rather than it being a clear standard to be used in one way only. This has lead to an ugly solution which can be ambiguous. This JSON format is a simple recommendation for how we might use a prettier structure in future to clarify the indended use.

The name Merkle Proof suggests that it can on its own prove something. I don't think this is the case as a blockheader is required to validate. Therefore the suggested name is a "Merkle Path".

## Specification

A Merkle Path needs to indicate the txid of the transaction in question, as well as the index number with respect to a block which contains it, as well as the block's hash.
The proposed JSON is:

```json
{ 
   "txid": "...a transaction id",
   "block": "...the block hash in which this tx resides",
   "index": 12,
   "leaves": [
      "...a leaf of the merkle path",
      "...a leaf of the merkle path",
      "...a leaf of the merkle path",
      "...a leaf of the merkle path",
      "...a leaf of the merkle path",
   ]
}
```
## Use

The idea is to use the Merkle Path like so:

1. Verify the txid is as expected.
2. Lookup the block header by hash provided using your headers service ([Pulse](https://github.com/libsv/pulse/))
3. Calculate the Merkle root from the txid and leaves.
4. Verify that the Merkle root matches that in your block header.
5. If all matches then store the Merkle path along side your transaction in your database for future use.

## Discussion

The main difference between this and the TSC Merkle Proof Standard Format is renaming a few labels:

### labels
- `txOrId` is dropped in favor of `txid` because the ambiguity is unnecessary, and full transactions have their own format considerations to focus on, hence separation of concerns.
- `nodes` are renamed to `leaves` because this more accurately describes the specific hashes we are referring to as those without children in a Merkle tree, and also disambiguates between these and bitcoin nodes or network nodes in general.  

### order
The order of items in the JSON is not strict but does imply a better general understanding. As a sentence: This transaction in this block is at index 12 with leaves... etc.
